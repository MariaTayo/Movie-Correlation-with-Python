# Movie-Correlation-with-Python

## Aim and Background

The aim of this project is to find movie correlations between variables using Python. I will be looking at correlations in the data to find the fields highly correlated with the gross revenue. The aim is to find the things that impact the revenue of a film. As part of the analysis I looked at the genre, gross revenue of the movies and release date. 

## About Dataset

There are 6820 movies in the dataset (220 movies per year, 1986-2016). Each movie has the following attributes:

budget: the budget of a movie. Some movies don't have this, so it appears as 0

company: the production company

country: country of origin

director: the director

genre: main genre of the movie.

gross: revenue of the movie

name: name of the movie

rating: rating of the movie (R, PG, etc.)

released: release date (YYYY-MM-DD)

runtime: duration of the movie

score: IMDb user rating

votes: number of user votes

star: main actor/actress

writer: writer of the movie

year: year of release

## Data Cleaning

I started by exploring the data and reviewing the first 5 rows of the dataframe.
